# Lesson 10 - AJAX, REST API's, & Promises

## Recap & Intro
- Last time we talked about jQuery and DOM manipulation
- So far, we've been on an island on the page. It's time to leave the island and communicate with the server.
- Data API's let JS get/set data to a server

## XHR
JavaScript has built in support for creating HTTP requests using the XML HTTP Request object (XHR) also known as AJAX.

- Requests are just like those your browser makes when navigating
	- URL - location of the resource
	- Header - Metadata about the request (e.g. type, expected response, cookies...)
	- Body	- Payload (e.g. post data)
- Response is text. API responses are usually JSON.
- Imagine navigating to a webpage, but instead of getting HTML, you get JSON text.
- Native API is low level, so libraries like jQuery are used.

Using raw XHR is pretty verbose, however, let's take a look:

##### JS
```javascript
function ajaxCall() {
    const ajaxRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();

    ajaxRequest.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (ajaxRequest.readyState == XMLHttpRequest.DONE ) {
           if (ajaxRequest.status == 200) {
               const myDiv = document.querySelector('.main');
               const newDiv = document.createElement('div');
               newDiv.innerHTML = ajaxRequest.responseText;
               myDiv.appendChild(newDiv);
           }
           else if (ajaxRequest.status == 400) {
              console.log('There was an error 400');
           }
           else {
              console.log('something else other than 200 was returned');
           }
        }
    };

    ajaxRequest.open("GET", 'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos', true);
    ajaxRequest.send();
}

(function(document){
  const myBtn = document.getElementById('myButton');
  myBtn.addEventListener('click', ajaxCall);
})(document);
```

###### corresponding html

```html
<body>
  <h2>A Simple ToDo Application</h2>
   <div class="main">
     <ul>
       <li><button type="button" id="myButton">Sync</button> <button type="button" id="deleteList">Clear List</button></li>
     </ul>

     <ul class="listOne"></ul>
  </div>
  <script src="main.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  </body>
```

### jQuery AJAX

By comparison, jQuery's AJAX methods are very simple. Let's look at an example 'GET' request.


```javascript
$.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos', function(todos){
	console.log(todos);
})
```
Notice the familiar callback pattern.

## REST API Principles
REST is a pattern for organizing API's, with a few simple rules
	- Uses HTTP request types as VERBS
	- Uses URL's to represent unique resources (NOUNS)

## Requests
Request types make up the verbs in a REST API.

	1. GET - Requests data, parameters in querystring
	2. POST - Submits data to be processed, parameters in body
	3. PUT - Adds or replaces item at a specific location
	4. DELETE - Deletes an item at a specific location

jQuery provides `$.get()` and `$.post()` methods for convenience and `$.ajax()` for general purpose.

#### Restful
- GET '/items'
- GET '/items?type=3'
- POST '/items/3'

#### NOT Restful

- POST '/items/new'
- GET '/items/add'
- DELETE '/items/removeItem/1'

### GET Requests
Get todo's with userId=1

```javascript
$.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos', {userId: 1}, function(t){

})


```

### POST Requests
Update last name of student with ID=3 to 'Smith'

```javascript
$.post('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos', {		
        completed: false,
		title: "Teach Promises",
		userId: 1},
	function(response){
		//Handle response, which usually contains the updated object including new ID's

	})
```

### PUT and DELETE
These are idempotent. You can put something 100 times and you'll only get one object saved.

```javascript
//Replace todo with id: 1

$.ajax({
	method: 'PUT',
	url: 'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1',
	data: {completed: false, title: "Teach REST", userId: 1},
	complete: function(response){
		//handle response which usually includes the updated object.
	}
})

//Remove the object at '/todo/3'
const newObject = $.ajax({
	method: 'DELETE',
	url: 'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/3',
	complete: function(response){
		//handle response
	}
})

```
### PUT vs POST
Both PUT and POST seem like they can create a resource, which can be confusing. Which one you use, depends on which resource you're performing the action on.

```
PUT /todos/1
POST /todos
```
You POST new data to a *collection* and PUT data at the location of an *object*

Another way to think about it is that POST is an operation like `x++`, while PUT is an assignment `x = 5`.


## Rendering data from an API
Rendering data returned by an API is pretty straight forward because the response is already a JS object or array.

Lets say you want to list the users...

```javascript
//Get reference to the list element
const list = $('ul#userList');

//Make a GET request for the items to render
$.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users', function(users){
	//Iterate over the response, adding elements to DOM
	users.forEach(function(user){
		const li = $('<li></li>');
		li.text(user.name);
		list.append(li);
	})
})
```

## Cross Origin Policy
By default, XHR requests are only allowed to the same domain the browser is currently on.
A Server has to enable CORS to allow browsers from other domains to make a successful request.

Our demo API has CORS support enabled, so you don't have to worry about it here... Just something to aware of in the future.


## Exercise 1: REST
Use jQuery to do the following things with the http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ API.

- Create buttons that do each of the tasks below
- Render the results to the page in html elements.
- Hide the results from the previous actions

    - Get all posts
    - Get post with id of 10
    - Get the comments from post with id of 12 <br> *note: comments are part of a different data model, you'll need to structure your endpoint to ask for all of the comments that belong to post #12*
    - Get all the posts from user with id of 2
    - Create a new post and log the id generated for it by the server
    - Replace the post with id of 12 and render the responseJSON
    - Update the title of post with id of 12 and render responseJSON
    - Delete the post with id of 12 and render a success message
    - Display a list of posts.
    	- When the user clicks on a post, display all the comments from that post
    	- Display a link back to all posts



## Problems with Callback Pattern
To this point, we've been using the **'Callback Pattern'**, which works great for simple cases, but breaks down in real world situations

### Callback Hell
Often times you want to perform multiple operations. For example, lets say you want all the posts and all the users...

```javascript
$.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', function(posts){
	$.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users', function(users)){
		//Do something with posts and users
	}
});
```
There are a couple of problems with following this pattern.

1. Its hard to follow
2. It executes in serial

### Messy error handling
With Callbacks, errors are typically handled by a second error handling function. E.g.

```javascript
somethingAsync(successFn, errFn);
```

Combine this with real world callback hell, and you have a real mess.

```javascript
const loggedInUsername = 'Bret';
$.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users?username=' + loggedInUsername, function(users){
	$.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=' + users[0].id, function(posts)){
		//Do something with posts
	},
	function(err){ //handle error from posts call

	}
}, function(err){ //handle error from users call.

});
```

Besides looking hideous, this pattern also prevents you from handling an error and executing the rest of the async operations.<br>
Imagine you had an error finding a user with that username, but wanted to show posts from a default user Id.

## Promises

- A promise is an object that represents an *eventual* value.
- Promises allow async code to behave synchronously
- There are many libraries that create promises, but they are built in to ES6

### Creating a Promise

```javascript
const p = new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
	//do something async...and get a value
	const myAsyncValue = 'abc'
	resolve(myAsyncValue);
});

p.then(function(data){
	//console.log(data);
})
```

Ok, so what's the big deal, aren't these just fancy callbacks?? Actually, Promises offer a number of benefits:

### Chaining
Promises can easily be chained to order multiple dependent asyc operations

```javascript
//------------ dataService.js ------------
function getUserByName(username) {
return new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
	 $.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users?username=' + username, function(users){
		 resolve(users[0]);
	 });
 })
}

function getPostsByUser(user) {
return new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
	 $.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=' + user.id, function(posts){
		 resolve(posts);
	 });
})
}

//------------ interface.js ------------

function render(posts) {
//render the posts data
console.log(posts);
}

function showUserItems(){
getUserByName('Bret')
 .then(getPostsByUser)
 .then(render);
}

showUserItems();
```

### Error handling
Using .catch(), you can handle errors in order

```javascript

function getUserByName(username) {
	return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
		 $.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users?username=' + username, function(users){
			 if(users.length)
			 	resolve(users[0]);
			else
				reject('User with name ' + username + 'not found');
		 });
	})
}

function handleUsernameError(err){
		console.warn(err, 'Using id=1 instead');
		return {
			username: "Sample User",
			id: 1
		};
}

function showUserItems(){
	getUserByName('Bret')
		.catch(handleUsernameError)
		.then(getPostsByUser)
		.then(render);
}
```

Once an error is thrown All `then` functions are skipped until a `catch` handles the error;

### Parallel execution
Promises let you perform a bunch of operations and do something when they've all completed. Lets say you want all the users and all the posts before rendering

```javascript
function getAllUsers() {
	return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
			$.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users', function(users){
				resolve(users);
			})
	})

}

function getAllPosts() {
	return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
			$.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', function(posts){
				resolve(posts);
			})
	})
}

const usersPromise = getAllUsers();
const postsPromise = getAllPosts();

Promise.all([userPromise, postsPromise])
	.then(function(results){
		const users = results[0];
		const posts = results[1];

		//Do something with users and posts
})

```

As you'd imagine, you can combine parallel and serial requests in a single promise chain.

```javascript
Promise.all([userPromise, postsPromise]) //parallel
	.then(function(results){ //serial
		const users = results[0];
		const posts = results[1];

		const p3 = somethingAsync(users);
		const p4 = somethingAsync2(posts);
		return Promise.All([p3,p4]); //parallel
})
	.then(/*...*/) //serial
```


### Instantly resolving promises
Sometimes you want a function that returns a promise object, but you already know the result. This is often done to "mock" API's.

```javascript
function getAllUsers() {
	return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
		resolve(['joe','lisa','shane']);
	})

	//or

	return Promise.resolve(['joe','lisa','shane']);
}

```
Even if a promise is resolved before a `.then()` is attached to it, the `then()` function is guaranteed to run.


## Fetch

A newer response to API requests is `fetch` <br>
`fetch` is built on promises. Which means that it returns a promise. Let's take a look

```javascript
fetch('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
  .then(function(response) {
    return response.json();
  }).then(function(data) {
  console.log(data);
  }).catch(function() {
  console.log("Booo");
});
```

## Exercise 2 - Working with Promises
Using the API at http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ create an app with the following functionality. Use Promises for everything.

1. **Login page** - Display a login form asking user for a username.
	- On Submit, look up the username entered by the user.
	- If no user is found, display a detailed error message.
	- If the user is found, store user object and render User's homepage
2. **User's homepage** displays:
	- User's name
	- User's post titles
	- User's albums
3. **Post View** - Clicking on a post renders a post view, including:
	- Post title
	- Post text
	- A list of comments on the post
	- A back link to the user homepage
4. **Album View** - Clicking on an album renders the album page, including:
	- Thumbnails of all the photos and the photo's title
	- A search box that filters the photos by title as the user types
	- A back link to the user homepage
